    "## Writing our first neural network code,  testing it  for the OR and XOR gates\n",
    "\n",
    "During week 41 we discussed three different types of gates, the\n",
    "so-called XOR, the OR and the AND gates.  In order to develop a code\n",
    "for neural networks, it can be useful to set up a simpler system with\n",
    "only two inputs and one output. This can make it easier to debug and\n",
    "study the feed forward pass and the back propagation part. In the\n",
    "exercise this and next week, we propose to study this system with just\n",
    "one hidden layer and two hidden nodes. There is only one output node\n",

    "The *MNIST* (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database is a large database\n",
    "of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.  \n",

    "represented as a 1D array of integers \n",
    "$Y = (n_{inputs}) = (5, 3, 1, 8,...)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, say we want to build a neural network using supervised learning to predict Body-Mass Index (BMI) from\n",

    "and weight (in kg). If we have measurements of 5 people the design/feature matrix could be for example:  \n",

    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",

    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems."
