    "Add now a model which allows you to make polynomials up to degree $15$.  Perform a standard OLS fitting of the training data and compute the MSE for the training and test data and plot both test and training data MSE as functions of the polynomial degree. Compare what you see with Figure 2.11 of Hastie et al. Comment your results. For which polynomial degree do you find an optimal MSE (smallest value)?"
